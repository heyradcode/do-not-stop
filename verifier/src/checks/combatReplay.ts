/**
 * Re-runs the fight and compares it to what the receipt claims (§F, §H item 1).
 *
 * This is the check the whole design exists for. Every input the engine consumes is in the
 * receipt — both pets frozen at acceptance, the seed, and the ruleset it names — so a
 * stranger can run the same simulation and get the same answer, or not. Nothing here asks
 * the operator for anything.
 *
 * Both the summary result and the blow-by-blow log are compared. The summary alone would
 * miss a receipt whose winner and round count are honest but whose published log tells a
 * different story about how it got there, so the recomputed log's hash is checked against
 * `combatLogHash` as well. That also means the log served separately by the operator
 * (`GET /api/battle/:battleId/combat-log`, §G) is pinned transitively: anything hashing to
 * `combatLogHash` is, by collision resistance, the log this replay produced.
 *
 * The `ruleset` must be the bundle the receipt names — the caller resolves it by hash, so
 * a mismatched bundle is not something this function can be handed.
