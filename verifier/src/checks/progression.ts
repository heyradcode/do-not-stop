/**
 * Recomputes the XP and level change the battle caused and compares it to what the receipt
 * claims (§F, §H item 1).
 *
 * This is what makes off-chain progression auditable at all. A pet's level is no longer
 * verifiable against the chain, so the honest version of "this pet is level 12" is "replay
 * the receipts that got it there and see". That is only a pure function of the receipt
 * because the snapshot freezes `lastOpponentId` and `streak`, the same-opponent decay state
 * XP depends on — without those a third party could only recompute this with access to our
 * tables, which is not replay.
 *
 * The level cap comes from the ruleset the receipt names, never from this build's defaults:
 * passing the wrong cap produces a mismatch, which is the correct outcome rather than a
 * false pass.
