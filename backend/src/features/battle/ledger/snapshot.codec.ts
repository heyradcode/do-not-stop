import type { BattleSnapshot, EquipEntry, PetSnapshot } from '@cryptopets/protocol';

/**
 * Reads a frozen snapshot back out of the ledger row it was stored in.
 *
 * The snapshot is persisted with `JSON.stringify`, which has no bigint, so `petId`, `dna`,
 * `lastOpponentId`, `sourceVersion` and an equipped item's `itemType` all come back as
 * decimal strings. The protocol types require real bigints, so nothing may hash, validate
 * or simulate a stored snapshot without going through here first.
 *
 * One decoder, used by every worker that reads the column. There were three, written
 * separately, and that is precisely how one of them came to be missing `schemaVersion` and
 * `equipment` after roadmap §4 added them: the signing worker rebuilt every snapshot at
 * layout version 1, its hash stopped matching the one acceptance committed, and the seed
 * check inside `assertBattleReceipt` refused every receipt. Adding a field to `PetSnapshot`
 * must be a change in one place, or the next field lands the same way.
 *
 * `schemaVersion` is carried verbatim and never defaulted. A row written before that field
 * existed genuinely is a version 1 snapshot with a receipt already signed over it, so
 * leaving it absent is what lets `assertBattleSnapshot` read it as 1; substituting this
 * build's current version would re-encode it under a layout it was never hashed under.
