/**
 * Battle-reward drops (roadmap §4).
 *
 * Seeded from the battle's own drand seed rather than from a new randomness source. That
 * seed is committed to a future drand round before the fight resolves, so nobody including
 * this server can grind a drop by re-rolling: changing the outcome would mean changing a
 * value that was published in advance. That property is real and it is the reason this
 * derives from the seed at all.
 *
 * Be precise about how far it goes, because it is easy to overstate and this comment used
 * to. A third party holding the receipt **cannot** recompute what should have dropped.
 * Two of the three inputs are unpublished: `DropRates` and `DROP_POOL` are constants in
 * this file and in `catalog.data.ts`, and neither reaches the ruleset, so neither is
 * covered by `rulesetHash` or by anything the receipt names. Only the seed and the battle
 * id are signed. Someone reading this source can reproduce a drop; someone holding only a
 * receipt and the published bundle cannot.
 *
 * Nor is the payout pinned by the receipt. `rates` is an argument, so the same seed and
 * battle id yield different answers under different rates, and nothing records which were
 * used. The operator cannot re-roll a drop, but can change the odds it was drawn against
 * without leaving a trace.
 *
 * Closing that means publishing the rates and the drop pool, which puts non-equipment
 * items into the ruleset. §4 deliberately keeps them out: a `rulesetHash` that moved every
 * time a collectible was added would re-prompt every defender for consent and train
 * players to click through the one prompt that matters. So this is a standing design
 * tension, not a missing field, and it is tracked as D2 in
 * `docs/plan-battle-inventory-hardening.md` rather than quietly fixed here.
 *
 * The pool is read from the shipped catalog constant rather than from `item_definition`,
 * deliberately. A replay has to reproduce what a battle dropped, and a table that content
 * edits underneath would give a different answer next month for the same seed.

 *
 * Idempotent under the retry that transaction can take. The entitlement's unique key is
 * (sourceRef, owner, itemType), and sourceRef is the battle id, so a replay of the same
 * battle collides with its own earlier row instead of paying twice.
 *
 * That same key is why the two sides are merged before writing rather than inserted as
 * they come. Nothing stops a player fighting two pets they both own, and then the winner
 * and the loser are one wallet; when both rolls land on the same item the two drops share
 * a key, and `skipDuplicates` silently keeps one. Measured on the shipped pool that is
 * about one in six of the self-battles that pay twice, each one quietly costing the player
 * an item they earned. Merging turns that into a single row of quantity 2, which is what
 * was owed.
 *
 * Returns what was written, not what was rolled, so a caller sees the same thing the table
 * does.
