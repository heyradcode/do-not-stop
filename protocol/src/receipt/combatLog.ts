/**
 * Hash of the blow-by-blow combat log.
 *
 * The log is presentation data: the client animates from it. Binding its hash into
 * the receipt is what stops the animation and the result being two different stories.
 * Without it, a player could be shown any sequence of strikes ending in the recorded
 * winner, and nothing would contradict it.
 *
 * The log is not itself in the receipt, because it is large and most readers never
 * want it. It is served separately and checked against this hash.
 *
 * No chain id or deployment id: the log is a pure function of the fight inputs, and the
 * receipt that references this hash already carries the domain.
