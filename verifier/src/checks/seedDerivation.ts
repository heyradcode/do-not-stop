 * Checks that the seed the fight ran on really follows from the receipt's own inputs
 * (§E, §H item 1): the domain, the drand randomness, the battle id, the snapshot, and the
 * ruleset hash.
 *
 * This is what stops a favourable seed being stapled onto a genuine beacon and a genuine
 * snapshot. `assertBattleReceipt` makes the same check internally — a receipt that fails
 * here also fails to hash at all — but it is reported as its own named check because
 * "the seed was chosen, not derived" and "this JSON is malformed" are very different
 * accusations, and collapsing them into one line would lose that.
