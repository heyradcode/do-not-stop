 * those numbers years later (§F, §H).
 *
 * Three kinds of thing live here, and the distinctions matter:
 *
 * - **Parameters the engine reads at runtime**: the skill/balance config and the
 *   level cap. These come from `GameConfig` on chain and are owner-tunable, so they
 *   have to travel with the receipt.
 * - **Engine identity**: `engineId` and `engineVersion`, plus `maxRounds` as a
 *   declared constant. The engine's own code cannot hash itself, so a fight-math
 *   change is recorded by bumping `engineVersion`. That bump is a manual step, and
 *   skipping it is how two different implementations end up claiming one ruleset.
 * - **Content that changes outcomes**: the item catalog (§4). Off-chain and
 *   owner-editable like the balance knobs, and in here for the same reason: a fight it
 *   could have changed has to name the version it ran under.
