/**
 * Runs every check §H item 1 calls for over a set of signed receipt envelopes: operator
 * signature, drand BLS beacon, seed derivation, combat replay, progression, and hash-chain
 * continuity across the run.
 *
 * Nothing here contacts the operator. Every input is either in the receipt itself or was
 * supplied by the caller (a trusted key list, published ruleset bundles), which is the
 * whole point — an answer that depended on the backend telling the truth would not be
 * verification.
 *
 * Every check is reported, not just the first failure. "The beacon is forged" and "the XP
 * is wrong" are different accusations, and a verifier that stopped at the first one would
 * make the second invisible.
 *
 * Two things fail closed rather than being skipped quietly:
 *
 * - A receipt that will not parse, or fails its own internal consistency
 *   (`assertBattleReceipt`), is reported as `malformed-receipt`. Only the checks that do
 *   not need a hashable receipt still run on it, and it is left out of the chain walk,
 *   which assumes well-formed members.
 * - A receipt naming a ruleset bundle the caller did not supply is reported as
 *   `ruleset-unavailable`, and its replay and progression checks do not run. Reporting
 *   those as passed would be a lie; silently omitting them would read as a clean bill of
 *   health.
