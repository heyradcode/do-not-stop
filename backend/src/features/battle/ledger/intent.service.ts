/**
 * Battle intent submission (§D).
 *
 * A JWT authorizes API access; it does not authorize a battle. It is a bearer token we
 * issued to ourselves, so a compromised API could mint one for any wallet and spend
 * someone else's pet's cooldown. The wallet signature is the authorization, and this
 * module's job is to refuse anything that is not one.
 *
 * What this deliberately does not do: create a ledger row. §J's `accepted` state means the
 * snapshot has been frozen and a drand round committed, which is the accept flow. Storing a
 * verified intent first keeps the nonce consumed (so a replay cannot get a second battle
 * even if acceptance fails) without inventing a ledger state that has no snapshot.
