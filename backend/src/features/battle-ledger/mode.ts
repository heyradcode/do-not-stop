/**
 * Gates the backend-authoritative battle mode (§L Phase 3).
 *
 * Only the *write* paths are gated. Reads — battle state, commitments, receipts, combat
 * logs, signing keys, rulesets, and the public corpus — stay open regardless, and that
 * asymmetry is deliberate: a deployment that runs backend battles for a while and then
 * switches the mode off has still issued signed receipts, and §H's claim is that anyone can
 * check them. Retracting the evidence along with the feature would turn every past receipt
 * into an assertion nobody can verify, which is the exact failure this design exists to
 * avoid. Turning the mode off stops new battles; it does not un-publish old ones.
 *
 * 503 rather than 404: the routes exist and the client did nothing wrong, the server is
 * simply not accepting battles. A client can tell the difference and say so.
