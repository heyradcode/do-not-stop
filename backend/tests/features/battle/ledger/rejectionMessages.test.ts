/**
 * Every refusal these two controllers can return has player-facing text.
 *
 * The status maps are `Record<AcceptRejection, number>` and `Record<IntentRejection,
 * number>`, so TypeScript already forces them to list every reason — which is why neither
 * has ever had a gap. Their keys are therefore the authoritative runtime list, and this
 * binds the message map to it.
 *
 * `MESSAGES` is a `Record<string, string>` and cannot be checked the same way: the reasons
 * are backend types and `@shared/core` must not import from `backend`. That looseness is
 * exactly what let nine reasons ship without text, falling back to `Battle refused:
 * item-catalog-stale` on screen.
 *
 * The fallback in `toBattleRejection` means a missing entry degrades rather than
 * disappears, so this is a quality check, not a crash guard. It is worth having anyway:
 * the degraded text is the internal slug, and a player who reads one cannot act on it.
