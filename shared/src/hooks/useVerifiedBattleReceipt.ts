/**
 * Verifies a signed battle receipt in the browser, then replays the fight from it (§H, §J).
 *
 * The order is the point. Everything animated here comes from *this client's own*
 * simulation of the receipt's inputs, not from a log the backend handed over — so what the
 * player watches is what the receipt commits to, or nothing is shown at all. The served
 * combat-log endpoint is deliberately not fetched for this: the log is regenerable from the
 * snapshot, the seed, and the ruleset, and regenerating it removes a trust dependency
 * instead of adding a round trip.
 *
 * The checks are imported from `@cryptopets/verifier`, the same code the standalone CLI
 * runs, rather than reimplemented against the same spec. A browser that verified receipts
 * its own way would eventually disagree with the public verifier, and §H's whole argument
 * is that it cannot.
 *
 * What is checked, all of it locally:
 *
 * - **operator signature** — the receipt hashes to what it claims and that hash was signed
 *   by a key in the published list.
 * - **drand beacon** — the BLS signature verifies against the pinned quicknet key. This is
 *   what makes commit-before-reveal mean anything; every cheaper check passes equally well
 *   for randomness the operator invented.
 * - **seed derivation** — the seed follows from the receipt's own inputs, so a favourable
 *   one cannot be stapled onto a genuine beacon.
 * - **combat replay** — re-running the fight reproduces the winner, rounds, winner HP, and
 *   the combat-log hash.
 * - **progression** — the XP and level change recomputes.
 *
 * Hash-chain continuity across a *run* of receipts is not checked here: a client holding one
 * receipt has nothing to link it against. That is the standalone verifier's job over the
 * public corpus, and pretending to do it from a single receipt would be theatre.
