/**
 * Starting a battle and following it to a verified result (§D, §E, §J).
 *
 * Battles are resolved by the backend, not on chain, so this no longer goes through the
 * chain adapter: there is nothing chain-specific left about running a fight. The wallet
 * still signs — the intent is what authorizes the battle (§D) — but no transaction is sent
 * and no gas is paid.
 *
 * What this returns is deliberately the same shape as the on-chain version, so the battle
 * UI keeps working: a `mutate`, a phase, a `liveReplay` to animate, and an `onSuccess`
 * carrying the resolved outcome.
 *
 * One thing genuinely changed, and it is the point of the design: `liveReplay` and the
 * authoritative result are now the *same computation*. The old flow animated a local
 * prediction and reconciled it against the chain afterwards; here the client verifies the
 * signed receipt and replays that, so what is animated is what the receipt commits to, or
 * nothing is animated at all.
