/**
 * Domain tags. Every canonical encoding in this protocol starts with exactly one
 * of these, so a digest can only ever be read as the kind of object it was
 * written as.
 *
 * Without a tag, two different objects that happen to encode to the same bytes
 * share a hash, and a signature over one becomes a signature over the other. A
 * receipt whose fields line up with a commitment's is the cheap version of that
 * attack; the tag makes it structurally impossible rather than unlikely.
 *
 * Rules:
 *
 * - Tags are frozen. Changing a tag's text changes every digest under it, which
 *   invalidates historical signatures. Add a new `_V2` tag instead.
 * - Tags are unique across the protocol. `tests/encoding/domain.test.ts`
 *   enforces this, because a duplicate silently reintroduces the confusion the
 *   tags exist to prevent.
 * - A tag is claimed by the object that uses it. Entries for objects that do not
 *   exist yet are declared here anyway, so the uniqueness check covers the whole
 *   protocol rather than only the parts already built.
