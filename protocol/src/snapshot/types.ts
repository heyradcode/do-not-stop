/**
 * One equipped item, frozen with the pet (roadmap §4, snapshot schema v2).
 *
 * Carries the **resolved** modifier rather than a reference to a catalog row, which is
 * the whole point: unequipping after acceptance must not change a committed fight, for
 * the same reason a level-up between acceptance and settlement must not. A replay needs
 * nothing but these numbers.
 *
 * `itemType` rides along even though the engine never reads it. It is what lets an
 * outsider cross-check the resolved numbers against the published catalog and against
 * the chain's own equip state at `sourceVersion`, so a geared receipt is checkable rather
 * than merely self-consistent (threat T13).
 *
 * Bonuses are non-negative and additive. The engine truncates to 16 bits with wraparound
 * rather than clamping, so a negative modifier is one underflow from a pet with 65,000 HP.

/**
 * One pet, frozen at acceptance. The "photo" from Part 1 of the architecture doc.

 * Two jobs. First, the fight is decided entirely by values written down before any
 * randomness existed, so a level-up between acceptance and settlement cannot
 * reroll a committed battle (the same attack `GameLogic.sol` closed on chain by
 * snapshotting sim inputs). Second, it makes the battle replayable by a stranger:
 * every input the ruleset consumes is here, in the receipt, rather than read live
 * from a database only we can see.
 *
 * That second job is why progression state is included. XP depends on
 * same-opponent decay, which lives in `lastOpponentId` and `streak`; without them
 * in the snapshot, progression could only be recomputed by someone with access to
 * our tables, which is not replay.
 *
 * Equipment arrived in schema version 2 (roadmap §4), at the cost that field always
 * carried. Version 1 snapshots have none and keep verifying unchanged.
