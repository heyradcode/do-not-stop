/**
 * An item's art, degrading in two steps rather than one.
 *
 * Unlike a pet — which falls straight back to its emoji avatar — an item has a real
 * intermediate: the service draws a deterministic SVG from the catalog entry alone, needing
 * no model, no store and no credentials. So the painted PNG is tried first, and anything that
 * stops it arriving (an item nobody has warmed yet, a generation that outran its deadline, a
 * deployment with no Cloudflare keys) falls through to art that is merely plainer instead of
 * to a hole in the layout.
 *
 * Only when the service itself is unreachable does this render nothing, which is the
 * "art is optional" state the whole image service is built around: unset
 * `VITE_IMAGE_SERVICE_URL` and the app keeps working, minus pictures.
 *
 * No retry timer, deliberately. `PetArt` needs one because its only fallback is an emoji and
 * a cold pet's art lands seconds later; here the second attempt is a different URL that is
 * always ready, so there is nothing to wait for.
