/**
 * The signed, permanent record of one battle.
 *
 * Everything needed to recompute the fight is here or reachable from here, which is
 * the whole point: we are not asking anyone to believe the result, we are publishing
 * the homework so anyone can mark it (§G, §H). A receipt that cannot be independently
 * recomputed is an assertion, and assertions are what this design exists to avoid.
 *
 * Three hash links, not one:
 *
 * - `previousReceiptHash` chains every receipt under a signing key, so removal or
 *   reordering breaks the chain and two receipts claiming one predecessor is provable
 *   equivocation.
 * - the two per-pet links exist because off-chain XP is not verifiable against the
 *   chain. Confirming a pet really was level 12 means replaying that pet's prior
 *   backend battles, and without a per-pet link that means scanning the entire ledger.
 *
 * `rewardDelta` from §G is deliberately absent: Phase 3 receipts carry no transferable
 * reward, and inventing the shape now would freeze a layout before the reward model
 * exists. Adding it is a `receipt` schema-version bump, which is what the version
 * registry is for.
