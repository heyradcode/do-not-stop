/**
 * Our signed statement, made before the dice land, of which future beacon round a
 * battle will use.
 *
 * This is the load-bearing object in the whole design. Public randomness alone
 * buys nothing: an operator who watches the beacon, dislikes the result, and then
 * claims the battle was always bound to a later round produces a perfectly
 * self-consistent lie. The fix is that the operator names the round in writing,
 * signs it, and hands it to the player *before that round exists*. A reroll then
 * requires a second signature over the same `battleId`, which either player's
 * stored copy turns into proof.
 *
 * Persisting the round in our own database is not a commitment, because the
 * database is ours. Neither is Merkle anchoring, which happens after computation.
 * Only delivery before reveal counts (§E).
