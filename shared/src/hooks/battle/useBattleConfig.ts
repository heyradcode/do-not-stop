/**
 * The deployment, chains, and active ruleset a client needs before it can build a signable
 * intent (`GET /api/battle/config`).
 *
 * None of this is derivable client-side, and guessing it fails late: a wrong `deploymentId`
 * is refused as `wrong-deployment` and a wrong `rulesetHash` produces a defence
 * authorization nobody's battle matches — both *after* the wallet prompt, which is the worst
 * possible moment to discover a configuration mistake.
 *
 * Cached for the session. These values change only when the deployment is redeployed or the
 * ruleset is retuned, neither of which happens mid-battle, and refetching per battle would
 * put a network round trip in front of every wallet prompt for no benefit.
