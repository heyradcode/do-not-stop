/**
 * The signer's shape, and the reason it is shaped this way (§G).
 *
 * The signing key is the one credential in this design that can produce a lie nobody can
 * detect from the outside. So the signer is built to be narrow rather than convenient:
 *
 * - **It never accepts a digest.** Callers pass a typed commitment or receipt, and the signer
 *   re-encodes and hashes it itself. A signer that accepts arbitrary 32 bytes is a signing
 *   oracle, and a stolen credential for one is worth as much as the key itself.
 * - **It signs exactly two kinds of object.** There is no generic state-mutation path, so
 *   there is nothing to widen later without noticing.
 * - **Receipts require attestations.** The engine and the independent verifier must both have
 *   agreed before a result becomes signed history.
 * - **Every request is logged with its digest and key id**, so a KMS audit log can be
 *   reconciled against what the pipeline believes it asked for. Unmatched digests are how a
 *   key compromise is spotted at all.
