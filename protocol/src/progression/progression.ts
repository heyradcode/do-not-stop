/**
 * Turns a frozen snapshot plus a winner into the progression change a battle causes.
 *
 * This is the piece that made off-chain XP possible. XP depends on same-opponent
 * decay state, which used to live only on chain, so the client-side port stopped at
 * fight math and receipts could not carry a meaningful progression delta. Now that
 * `lastOpponentId` and `streak` are frozen into the snapshot, progression is a pure
 * function of the receipt's own inputs, which means a stranger can recompute it
 * without access to any of our tables (§F).
 *
 * Levels come from the snapshot, not from live state, matching the fix already made
 * on both chains: the simulation and the XP calculation agree on one set of committed
 * inputs instead of one using frozen levels while the other reads whatever the live
 * values happen to be at settle time.
