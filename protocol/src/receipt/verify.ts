/**
 * The checks a receipt can be held to on its own, without the combat log and without any
 * data from us.
 *
 * `assertBattleReceipt` already covers the cheap internal consistency (randomness is the
 * signature hash, seed follows from the inputs, times are ordered). This adds the two
 * expensive ones: the BLS signature, and recomputing the progression delta.
 *
 * What is *not* here: replaying the fight itself. That needs the ruleset's skill config,
 * which this module deliberately does not take, so it belongs to the standalone verifier
 * where the published bundle is resolved alongside. Progression is checkable here because
 * the snapshot carries the streak state it depends on.
 *
 * Each half is also exported on its own, because their preconditions differ: the beacon
 * check needs nothing but the receipt, while progression needs the level cap from the
 * ruleset the receipt names.
