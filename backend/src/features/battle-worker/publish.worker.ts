/**
 * Handles `publish` messages: `signed` -> `published` (§J).
 *
 * The receipt row is written by the sign worker, and the public corpus serves it from that
 * moment, so this transition does not perform publication so much as confirm it. What it
 * adds is the last integrity gate before the receipt is treated as publicly final: the
 * stored payload is parsed back through the protocol types, revalidated, and re-hashed, and
 * the digest must equal the id it is stored under.
 *
 * That is worth doing precisely because it should never fail. A row that no longer hashes
 * to its own key means the payload was corrupted between signing and storage — by a bad
 * serialization, a partial write, a schema drift — and the signature over it no longer
 * proves anything. Catching that here stops us announcing a receipt nobody can verify;
 * catching it later means a third party finds it first, which is the outcome this whole
 * design exists to avoid.
 *
 * A mismatch throws rather than transitioning to a failure state. There is no honest
 * `publish_failed` outcome for a battle that was already signed: the fight really did
 * happen and the signature really was issued, so the correct response is a dead-lettered
 * message and a human looking at why storage disagrees with what was signed.
