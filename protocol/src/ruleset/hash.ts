/**
 * Canonical encoding of a ruleset.
 *
 * No chain id or deployment id, unlike every other hashed object here. A ruleset is
 * portable by design: the same rules can run on either chain, and binding the hash to
 * a deployment would give one set of rules as many identities as it has environments,
 * which would make consent bound to `rulesetHash` mean less rather than more. Where a
 * deployment matters, the object referencing the ruleset already carries it.
 *
 * The schema version is written directly for the same reason: `writeHeader` bundles
 * version with domain, and there is no domain here. It comes from the ruleset rather than
 * from this build, so re-encoding a bundle published before the item catalog existed
 * reproduces the bytes it was hashed under.
