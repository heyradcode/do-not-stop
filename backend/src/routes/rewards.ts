 * Reward seasons and claim proofs (§I).
 *
 * No `verifyToken` anywhere here, matching the receipt corpus. A claim proof only ever pays
 * the wallet bound inside its leaf, so publishing one lets a third party sponsor someone's
 * gas rather than take their reward — and the season metadata is what makes the arithmetic
 * checkable by anyone at all.
 *
 * Deliberately read-only. Building a season and opening it on chain are operator actions
 * with real money attached; they belong behind an owner key and a deliberate command, not
 * an HTTP route that could be reached by anything holding a token.
