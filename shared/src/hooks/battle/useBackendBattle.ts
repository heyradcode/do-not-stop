 * The authoritative view of one backend-resolved battle (§J).
 *
 * `GET /api/battle/:battleId` is the source of truth, and the room socket is only a hint
 * that it is worth asking again. That ordering is the whole design: a client that missed
 * every notification, or was never connected, converges on exactly the same state by
 * polling this endpoint. The socket makes that faster, never more authoritative — so a
 * dropped connection degrades to slower updates, not to wrong ones.
 *
 * The refetch on reconnect matters as much as the one on notification. A socket that was
 * down for ten seconds missed whatever happened in those ten seconds, and reconnecting
 * without re-reading would leave the client confidently stale.
