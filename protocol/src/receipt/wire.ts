/**
 * JSON wire form of a `BattleReceipt`: identical shape, except the bigint fields (pet id,
 * dna, last-opponent id, source version) travel as decimal strings, since JSON has no
 * bigint type. This is exactly what the backend's public receipt endpoints actually serve —
 * `backend/src/features/battle-worker/sign.worker.ts` stores the receipt through a
 * `JSON.stringify(receipt, bigint -> string)` replacer, and the read/corpus routes hand that
 * stored payload back unchanged.
 *
 * `receiptFromWire` converts only; it does not validate. `assertBattleReceipt` is what makes
 * a converted receipt trustworthy — a field that fails to convert cleanly (a non-numeric
 * string handed to `BigInt(...)`) throws before that even runs, and everything else
 * (ranges, hash consistency, chain-link shape) is `assertBattleReceipt`'s job, not this one's.
