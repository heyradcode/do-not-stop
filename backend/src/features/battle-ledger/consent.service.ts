/**
 * Standing defender consent (§D).
 *
 * The problem: backend ranked mode must not apply cooldown and rating changes to an
 * unwilling defender, but demanding a live signature per battle would mean you can only
 * fight players who are online. That is a large product regression, so consent is signed
 * once, in advance, and bounded by a level band, a daily cap, a validity window, and a
 * ruleset version.
 *
 * The ruleset binding is the part with a running cost: a balance change invalidates every
 * outstanding authorization and prompts every player to re-consent. That is the intended
 * trade. It is what makes "I never agreed to these combat rules" a checkable claim instead
 * of an argument.
