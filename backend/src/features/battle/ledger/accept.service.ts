/**
 * The accept flow (§E, §J).
 *
 * This is where the one ordering that can never be relaxed is enforced in code: the photo is
 * taken, a round that has not published yet is chosen, the commitment is signed, and the
 * signed commitment is the thing this function *returns* — synchronously, in the same
 * response that told the caller their battle was accepted. There is no path that answers
 * "accepted" without the caller also receiving the signed commitment: if round-selection or
 * signing fails, the ledger row this call created is unwound to `rejected` and the caller is
 * told the battle was never accepted at all.
 *
 * Three stages, deliberately not one transaction:
 *
 * - **Stage A** (one DB transaction, in `openBattle`): consume the intent, lock both pets, and
 *   persist the frozen snapshot — before any randomness for this battle exists. This is
 *   `accepted`.
 * - **Stage B** (network + KMS, no DB writes): choose a drand round that has not published,
 *   build the commitment, sign it.
 * - **Stage C** (one DB transaction, in `applyTransition`): record the commitment and move to
 *   `committed`; or, if Stage B failed, move Stage A's row to `rejected` and release the locks.
 *
 * Splitting it this way means a crash between Stage A and Stage C leaves a diagnosable
 * `accepted` row rather than losing the intent's consumption with no trace at all.
