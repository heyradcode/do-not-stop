/**
 * Handles `sign` messages: `verified` -> `signed` (§G).
 *
 * This is where a computed, cross-verified battle becomes a permanent, checkable
 * record. Three things happen atomically with the state move: the receipt row is
 * created, both pets' off-chain progression is applied (level, XP, streak,
 * opponent history, win/loss count, cooldown), and both pets' per-pet receipt
 * chain head advances — because a receipt that updated progression but did not
 * record itself as that pet's new chain head would make the next battle's
 * `attackerPreviousReceiptHash` a lie.
 *
 * The signer itself refuses to sign anything that is not a well-formed receipt
 * with the required attestations (`battle-signer`'s job, not this file's), so
 * this worker's job is assembling the receipt correctly and handling the one
 * real race: two different battles under the same signing key contending for
 * the next global chain position.
