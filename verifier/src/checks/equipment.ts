/**
 * Confirms each pet's frozen modifiers are the ones its items are supposed to grant
 * (roadmap §4, threat T13).
 *
 * The comparison itself is `findEquipmentMismatches` in `@cryptopets/protocol`, not a copy
 * here. It gained a second caller once the backend began refusing a battle at acceptance
 * on the same grounds, and two implementations of one comparison would drift into a battle
 * that accepts and then fails to verify — with the comparison the last thing anyone would
 * suspect. This function's own job is the part that is specific to verifying: naming the
 * check and shaping the result.
 *
 * What it still does not prove is that the pet *owned* the item. That is a claim about
 * chain state at `sourceVersion`, which this package deliberately cannot read — it has no
 * network access, by design. A verifier that wants that checks `ItemCore.equipmentOf` at
 * the recorded version itself; this narrows the remaining trust to exactly that one
 * question.
